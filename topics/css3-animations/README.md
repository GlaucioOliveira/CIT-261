### CSS3 Animations
> Designing, Defining, and Triggering CSS3 Animations without Custom Libraries.

With CSS Animations we are able to create animations with HTML elements without the need of a custom library. The difference between CSS Animations and (CSS Transition)[../css3-transitions/README.md] that on the Animations we are able to specify what will happen at a specific time of the animation (using `@keyframes`). This is not possible with Transition alone.
